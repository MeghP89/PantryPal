# Project Overview: Smart Kitchen Assistant

## 1. Core Concept

The Smart Kitchen Assistant is a mobile application designed to be an all-in-one tool for managing home inventory, planning meals, and discovering new recipes. It aims to reduce food waste, streamline grocery shopping, and make cooking a more enjoyable and organized experience.

## 2. Key Features

### a. Inventory Management
- **Track Items:** Users can add items to their digital pantry, including details like quantity, category, and nutritional information.
- **Nutritional Analysis:** The app can read nutritional labels from images, automatically parsing and storing data like calories, macronutrients (protein, carbs, fat), and more.
- **Smart Categorization:** Items are automatically grouped into logical categories (e.g., Produce, Dairy, Meat) for easy browsing and management.
- **Edit and Update:** Users can easily edit item details, update quantities, and remove items from their inventory.

### b. Recipe & Meal Planning
- **Recipe Generation:** The application can intelligently generate new recipes based on the items currently available in the user's inventory, helping to use up ingredients before they expire.
- **Personal Cookbook:** Users can save their favorite recipes, creating a personal digital cookbook.
- **Recipe Details:** Each recipe includes a description, difficulty level, estimated cooking time, a list of ingredients, and step-by-step instructions.
- **Recipe Overview:** A modal view provides a detailed breakdown of a recipe's ingredients and steps.

### c. Smart Shopping List
- **Automated List:** The app helps users build a shopping list. This can be done manually or by adding ingredients directly from a recipe.
- **Categorized & Prioritized:** The shopping list is organized by item category (to match a typical grocery store layout) and allows users to set priorities (low, medium, high).
- **Cost Estimation:** Users can add estimated prices to shopping list items, and the app will calculate the total estimated cost of a grocery run.
- **Progress Tracking:** Users can mark items as completed as they shop.

## 3. User & Authentication
- **Sign-up & Login:** The application includes a complete user authentication flow, allowing users to create accounts and log in securely.
- **Personalized Data:** All data (inventory, recipes, shopping lists) is tied to the user's account, ensuring a personalized and private experience.

## 4. Technology Stack

- **Framework:** React Native with Expo
- **Language:** TypeScript
- **UI Components:** React Native Paper for Material Design components.
- **Navigation:** Expo Router for file-based routing.
- **Backend & Database:** Supabase for authentication, database, and real-time updates.
- **Styling:** Custom StyleSheet implementation with a consistent, modern theme.
- **Modals & Overlays:** Custom-built modals with blur effects for a polished user experience.
- **Linting & Formatting:** ESLint for code quality and consistency.
